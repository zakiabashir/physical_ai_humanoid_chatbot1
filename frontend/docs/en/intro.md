# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the AI-Native Textbook Platform for **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Unlike purely digital AI, physical AI systems must understand and navigate real-world environments.
